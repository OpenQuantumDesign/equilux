## Components of a Trapped Ion Quantum Computer

* **Vacuum chamber:** ultra-high vacuum environment isolates the ions from the environment.
* **Trapping electrodes:** uses electromagnetic potentials to trap ions within an area of the chamber.
* **Lasers:** an array of lasers at different wavelengths and powers initialize, manipulate, and measure the ions in the trap.
* **Optical elements:** many optical components around the lasers control the beams’ frequency, polarization, phase, and intensity.
* **Control electronics:** real-time control electronics orchestrate all of the components, utilizing field programmable gate array (FPGA) cards and radiofrequency components.
* **User interface:** software lets users access and run the quantum computer in order to test ideas, run algorithms, and develop use-cases.

## What's unique about OQD's quantum computer?

* All-to-all connectivity of qubits, high fidelity operations, and long-coherence times.
* Agile and ultra-low crosstalk addressing of ions via a novel optical addressing scheme.
* Ion trap and control systems that are designed from the ground up for mid-circuit measurements.
* Modular real-time control hardware, building on top of the Sinara open-hardware ecosystem.
* Reusable and extensible control software, aimed at replicating control elements across different trapped ion systems.
* Ability to program the computers at multiple levels of abstraction, depending on users’ needs and expertise. This includes defining and running quantum programs as digital circuits, analog circuits, and atomic protocols.
* Suite of state-of-the-art classical emulator backends for testing, prototyping, and validating quantum programs.

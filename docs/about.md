Open Quantum Design (OQD) is a non-profit organization. Our mission is to develop full-stack open-source quantum computer designs by fostering a collaborative community of diverse contributors from academia, industry, and government. 
OQD's current designs are based on laser-cooled trapped ion quantum computing hardware and software. 
The OQD intellectual property was developed by University of Waterloo Professors Crystal Senko, Rajibul Islam and Roger Melko, with physicists, engineers, and computer scientists working at the [Institute for Quantum Computing](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/) and the [Perimeter Institute Quantum Intelligence Lab](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/perimeter-institute-quantum-intelligence-lab-piquil).

OQD’s technology features novel and scalable approaches for the trapping, control, and read-out of ions. This includes a unique blade trap design, agile optical scheme for low crosstalk addressing of the ions, high-fidelity and all-to-all gate connectivity, and native support for mid-circuit measurements.

All components of the stack will be open under an Apache 2.0 or similar license - from hardware designs and the middleware control stack, to the top level programming interfaces. OQD’s vision is to be a global leader in open quantum technology, driving breakthroughs that revolutionize science, industry, and society, in order to improve the quality of life for future generations. 

## Why Open?

Open-source is more accessible and a proven environment for innovation. By sharing resources, knowledge, and designs, a global community of participants from diverse backgrounds can contribute to and accelerate the development of quantum technologies. OQD is building a collaborative community for technology co-creation, in order to democratize and accelerate the benefits of quantum computing technologies for all. Our purpose is to harness the potential of open quantum technology for the betterment of society, ensuring equitable access to its benefits, to foster an environment for innovation, and nurture the quantum workforce of the future.


## OQD’s open-source approach:
 
* Provides transparency and accessibility to software and hardware
* Deepens connections between academia, industry, and government through a collaborative sandbox with clear rules of engagement
* Builds trust through collective decision-making to the benefit of the ecosystem and technology
* Fosters collaboration on the hardest technical challenges
* Increases cost-efficiency through collaboration and standards development
* Attracts and mobilizes IP into the quantum ecosystem
* Fuels outreach and education to train the next generation of scientists and entrepreneurs
